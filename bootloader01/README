see top level README for documentation and how to run this program

This is a simple uart0 based bootloader, you feed it motorola srecord
files and then press g to run.  Careful not to overwrite the bootloader
itself.  It technically starts at 0x41000000 but then branches over
some space where you can run.

.globl _start
_start:
    b   reset

.space 0x20000-4,0

reset:
    mov sp,#0x42000000
    bl notmain
hang: b hang

Need to modify that and the linker script if you want more space.

MEMORY
{
    ram : ORIGIN = 0x41000000, LENGTH = 0x21000
}
